# Create a DHRIFT Community Landing Page

# Before you begin

For an optimal experience, assemble key information about your institute in advance. Institute landing pages can be recreated; however, each new iteration will currently overwrite a previous institute, so you will want to save copies of your previous answers.

Information you will need includes:

- [ ] A title, description, format, location, and contact information for your event.  
- [ ] Dates, times, and locations for workshops  
- [ ] Names of instructors and assistants  
- [ ] A GitHub account and login information

For more information about how to make the most out of your DHRIFT landing page, please see our documentation.
